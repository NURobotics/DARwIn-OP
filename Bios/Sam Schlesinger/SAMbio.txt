Hi, I’m Sam Schlesinger. I’m a senior Mechanical Engineering student in McCormick. I’m also doing a CS minor. I’m interested and have gained experience in robotics through 2 years of participation in the NU Autonomous Robotics Design Competition, and working the the Argallab robotics laboratory this summer.

Outside class, I have also been involved in my fraternity, Wildside, and Dance Marathon. During my free time I like to play piano, go hiking, and watch baseball.
