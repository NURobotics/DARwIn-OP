In order to connect to Darwin we will primarily be using the ssh protocol.

You must be connected to the same WiFi network as Darwin in order to properly
ssh into Darwin.

If you want to use a wired connection through Ethernet, in order to ssh in 
terminal you have to use the command:

ssh darwin@192.168.123.1

When the password is prompted type: 111111


In order to connect to Darwin through WiFi:

ssh darwin@10.105.198.253

When the password is prompted type: 111111

Now you should be in Darwin.

In order to get into Darwin's project that uses the library you want to 
get out of the home directory and into the darwin directory by using 
cd .. until you can't any further.

From there type cd darwin and then cd Linux and you are able to write your 
own code.
